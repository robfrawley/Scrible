# Jabiru

A PHP 5.6 Markdown parser supporting a specific subset/superset of the original Markdown implementation.

***

This is a fork of [kzykhys/Ciconia](https://github.com/kzykhys/Ciconia) that will *not* be maintaining backwards compatability. This is still in the very early stages of being rewritten to leverage PHP 5.6 as well add additional features required for Scribe Inc. It is highly suggested to visit the original author's project if you are planning on using this bundle (for the time being).
